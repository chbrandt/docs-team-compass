The term "Jupyter" can mean different things depending on the context it is being used: Jupyter, the notebook; Jupyter, the server; Jupyter, the project.
It is not unusual to fill confused with the many uses of "Jupyter", especially 
for new comers, so let's try to clear off the fog.

There is extensive documentation of the many parts and components of Jupyter
which we'll use here to refer the reader to.
This document is a companion to the [History of Jupyter][] (HoJ), and supplemental
to the Projects pages in Jupyter Docs ([`docs.jupyter.org > Projects`](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/content-projects.html)).

### What's *inside* Jupyter?
[nbformat]: nbformat.jupyter.org

At the core of Jupyter we will find the [**notebook** file format][nbformat].
A *notebook* is a document where programming and spoken languages 
(ie, code and text) meet to create executable scientific articles.
Notebooks find their use through different applications: data story telling, reproducible science, interactive tutorials, etc.

Around notebooks, there is a whole ecosystem of software components to support
the different uses of it: notebook editors, converters to/from other formats,
cloud services, and a whole lot of tools and libraries. *Most* of the software
is written in Python because of the origins of Jupyter (see HoJ), but not only.

### What's the structure of Jupyter?

Jupyter is developed completely in the open, by the community, but there is a
personnel structure guiding the developments and taking care of the resources.
The actual development of the software components are done in the scope of
[Jupyter (sub)projects][subprojects].

While some subprojects take care of the development of a specific software 
component, other projects will take care of broader discussions, such as the
[Accessibility][] and [Security][] projects.

In the following sections we are going to define the major components of the 
Jupyter ecosystem. This is *not* a complete reference of every aspect of Jupyter,
but rather a clarification document of the complexity of Jupyter content.

## Jupyter software

The graph below presents the best known software components of the Project.
There are many other components -- like Jupyter-Server, Jupyter-Kernels --
that we will talk about later, but for starter we go with the most common ones.

Connections and groups in this diagram are not formal relationships but
simple indicators to help us draw the big picture in the next sections.

### *Notebook* vs *notebook*
[nbformat.readthedocs.io]: https://nbformat.readthedocs.io
[jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io]: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io

Probably the most overloaded term within the community is "notebook".

Formally, "notebook" has two meanings: the **notebook file format** -- the `.ipynb` 
files -- where data/content are stored (ie, the digital document); 
And the **Jupyter-Notebook** application for editing and running notebook files.

Jupyter-Notebook -- the application -- may be referred simply as "Notebook".
As in many situations in life, discerning between the (notebook) file/document
and the (Notebook) application should be clear from the context.

In Jupyter official documentation we refer to the application as Jupyter-Notebook 
or simply Notebook with capital "N". 
The digital file/document is written as a common name (ie, lower-case) notebook.

You can find detailed information about notebook file format, `nbformat`, and
the frontend application in their respective official documentation:

- Notebook file format: [nbformat.readthedocs.io][]
- Jupyter-Notebook: [jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io][]


### *Notebook* and *Lab*
[jupyterlab.readthedocs.io]: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io

There are two applications (aka, frontends) to edit and run notebooks:
Jupyter-Notebook and Jupyter-Lab. Jupyter-Lab is an evolution of Jupyter-Notebook, 
it provides a more concise and customizable user interface.

It is mostly a matter of preference which application/interface to use, 
they both provide pretty much the same functionalities on what regards editing 
and running notebook documents.
The *Lab* provides a richer graphical user interface (GUI), whereas *Notebook*
provides a simpler GUI.

Personally, I like to use Jupyter-Lab on my daily work as a data analyst, and 
Jupyter-Notebook while teaching so we can all focus on the notebook's content.

Regarding ambiguous use of terms, sometimes people will refer to Jupyter-Lab 
as "Notebook"; This is certainly the case among old practitioners, that used
the Notebook application extensively in a time prior to Jupyter-Lab.

### What about *Hub*?
[jupyterhub.readthedocs.io]: https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io

Jupyter-Hub is a manager of Jupyter-Lab and Jupyter-Notebook instances in
multi-user settings. 

In a Jupyter-Hub setup editing and running notebook files is
still performed by Lab and Notebook, the Hub is responsible for authenticating
users and handling them their corresponding Lab/Notebook instance connection.

Jupyter-Hub can be set up in different system configurations: in a single computer,
in a cluster of computers, in containers in the cloud.
The Hub is quite flexible and easy to extend for specific multi-user scenarios.

### IPython, Jupyter-Widgets and IPyWidgets

Once upon a time, there was only IPython, and among many other things
(see the [History of Jupyter][]) `ipywidgets` as the library providing 
interactive widgets (buttons, sliders, etc) to be used in Jupyter notebooks.

It took some time for IPyWidgets to be renamed after "Jupyter", but it eventually
happened (or *is happening*).
To not break compatibility with older code-bases, the  software library is
still called `ipywidgets`.
The subproject and high-level references to the widgets were renamed to
Jupyter-Widgets.
By all means, **Jupyter-Widgets** and IPyWidgets are the very same thing.

- Jupyter-Widgets: [ipywidgets.readthedocs.io][]

Going back to IPython... The **IPython** project is responsible for many
important packages, some are fundamental and some are *just* very helpful.
For the readers of this document, I want to highlight IPython's:

- interactive shell: [ipython.readthedocs.io/interactive/tutorial][]
- magic commands: [ipython.readthedocs.io/interactive/magics][]
