# Get involved

[Issue #27 of docs-team-compass](https://github.com/jupyter/docs-team-compass/issues/27)
highlights the need for a better "get involved" page in jupyter.org.
The page, https://jupyter.org/community, as put in the description of the issue,
could be improved to better guide potential contributors.

## An holistic view of community channels

It would be helpfull to have an holistic view of each project's channel
of communication.

> In the first part of table below, the projects list are taken from the page
> above (jupyter.org/community).
> In the second part, the project names were added based on my knowledge of
> Jupyter projects.

## Jupyter-Org duplicated pages

Jupyter.org has a couple of duplicated pages among jupyter.org and docs.jupyter.org:

- Community:
    - https://jupyter.org/community (as "Get Involved")
    - https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/community/content-community.html

- Contributing:
    - https://jupyter.org/community (as "Get Involved")
    - https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/contributing/content-contributor.html

I understand those pages are well-paced in the [docs](docs.jupyter.org) website,
the suggestion is to have the ["Get Involved"](jupyter.org/community)
page in jupyter.org simply pointing to those in the docs, eliminating
sections "explore our projects", "live events", "jupyter community calls",
and maybe "jupyter community workshops" (to be moved to *docs/community*).

## Blog

Advertise [Jupyter blog](https://blog.jupyter.org/) in jupyter.org
as *Blog* instead of *News* (in the top menu).
