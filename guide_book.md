# Docs Working Group Guide Book

This document contains current guiding principles and practices that guide the operation of the Jupyter Docs Working Group.

# Guiding principles and recommendations

Contributors should use these principles to guide their work:

- Prefer plain language
    - For accessibility to a wide range of people with different backgrounds
    - Recommendations:
        - Where jargon is used, define it in-document or link out to a glossary or other source
- Deep page heirarchies:
    - Offer opportunities to provide detail without overwhelming readers (length and detail)
    - Provide more focused single-topic documents
    - Recommendations:
        - Break up long documents into separate parts where feasible
        - Structure complex information into separate, focused topics where feasible
- Interlinking between pages within a project, and to other projects, is good
    - Project Jupyter (meta) docs in particular are relevant to many subprojects and are a good target for interlinking
- Docs should not be broken on release

## Insights, Challenges and Opportunities

This group has identified some insights and challenges (and related opportunities) that will help guide our work:

- Users often express that it's challenging to get a unified view of "what is Jupyter" and how the components work together.
    - We should work to remedy this and provide more explanation and context in appropriate places.
- Jupyter's modular approach (from The Big Split) can make it difficult to communicate the right information in the right place. Insights from one project can be relevant to other subprojects, and some information spans multiple subprojects.
    - We should encourage consistency and cross-linking across the Jupyter ecosystem and between different subprojects.
    - Create a docs page that links to all projects and their user-facing documentation (This page will help provide an easy way to link out to the different subproject's docs).
- There should be multiple ways to consume docs, through multiple points of delivery.
- Plain Language should as much as possible to facilitate inclusivity for people of different backgrounds in the Jupyter community
