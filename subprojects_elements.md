# Jupyter Subprojects Features

Jupyter subprojects documentation present themselves with different features,
according to their intended users and developers decisions.
It is important for us to recognize those features and understand their use
so we can identify how to homogenize them across the projects; and *if* other
projects would benefit from them.

For instance, the JupyterHub projects is frequently referred as one with
an overall very good documentation.
As pointed out in the [Issue #7](https://github.com/jupyter/docs-team-compass/issues/7)
the project used the [Diátaxis Framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to structure
that documentation, which is the kind of *feature* of interest recognizing.

The list of subprojects below was taken from [Jupyter's Governance webpage](https://jupyter.org/governance/list_of_subprojects.html)
