# Docs Working Group Charter (Proposed)
## Goals

The Docs Working Group's goals should serve the end users of Jupyter projects.
The Docs Working Group serves to support, assist, and advise Jupyter subprojects on documentation best practices.

## Docs WG's scope and role

- Help write docs (inside the bounds of each subproject's governance)
- Develop recommendations and guidance:
	- For communicating common information and concepts across the Jupyter ecosystem
	- For style and best practices when authoring documentation media (including technical advice such as tools-usage and markdown guidance that helps support high level goals, like interlinking/cross-connection between subprojects)
	- ...because we want to encourage consistency across the Jupyter ecosystem and between different projects
- Community engagement
	- To help connect users with information
	- To gather feedback from the community about what needs to be documented/what information they need
- Help support and improve all aspects of documentation across the Jupyter ecosystem
	- This means, for members of the group, also taking on any related tasks that will be beneficial to docs and support the Docs Working Group's goals (such as writing PRs for unit tests related to documentation code, automations for gathering ReadTheDocs traffic stats, etc.)

One reason for starting the Docs Working Group is to provide a place for consistent, focused effort to be spent specifically on docs across the whole ecosystem.

In other words, the Docs Working Group exists in part to provide capacity and resources to the subprojects (some of which are already suffering from a lack of resources/capacity, and more specifically to work on docs in particular).

Reflecting on the above, a goal/mission for the group might boil down to:

### Goals/Mission

- Help support and improve all aspects of documentation across the Jupyter ecosystem
- Make high quality documentation that is clear, comprehensive, inclusive, and serves the varying needs of Jupyter's diverse community
- Engage with the community to help users with Jupyter products, and to get them the information they need
